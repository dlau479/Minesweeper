# MineSweeper
---

This is my attempt at using Java [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/ "Spring Boot"). The Goal was to use this framework and create Minesweeper by using only Java and Spring Boot extensions.

When the program is ran the game will look as follows:
- Start Screen
    ![](/pictures/start.jpeg)
- Game
    ![](/pictures/newgame.jpeg)
- Move Made
    ![](/pictures/action.jpeg)
- End Game
    ![](/pictures/gameover.jpeg)

To run this program you will need:

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

[Java](https://openjdk.org/)


To run the code you can use this command to start the game.
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
